# Purpose
This project is the source code for the paper *Time Series Forecasting based on High-Order Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Wavelet Transform*, which is now submitted to **IEEE TFS** for review.


# Usage
The file *Wavelet_HFCM.py* is the main program to perform forecasting time series by using Wavelet-HFCM. And the outcomes about the effects of two hyper-parameters (the order *k* and number of nodes *Nc*ï¼‰on Wavelet-HFCM are saved into the directory *./Outcome_for_papers/impact_parameters*/

# Requirements
- python 3.+
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy
